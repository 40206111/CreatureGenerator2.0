# CreatureGenerator2.0
In 2019 for my Advanced Games Module at University I worked on a program that could procedurally generate creatures. It is now 2022 and I've decided to try again and do it better.

## What I'm hoping to manage with this version: ##
- [ ] Better Mesh Generation.
  - [ ] possibly not using marching squares
  - [ ] have no holes in the mesh
  - [ ] have it generate faster
- [ ] Nicer UI
  - [ ]  Originally the UI was very last minute and I didn't really know how to do it, this time I will make it nicer and more user friendly
- [ ]  Hierarhy of Body Parts
    - [ ] Have the different parts of the creature exist in a hierarchy
    - [ ] allow for seperation of mesh on body parts that should not be connected
    - [ ] allow for possible animation... maybe... possibly... maybe
- [ ] Coloured/Textured mesh
  - [ ] hopefully when I have the rest working I can give the new creature model nice colours and or textures
